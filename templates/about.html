            <div class="question">
                Why yet another platform for interview questions?
            </div>
            <div class="answer">
                We know the internet is filled with the interview experiences and stuffs related to it but still
                a lots of universities maintains a personal repository of the interviewing experiences of their students
                it not only helps to figure out the companies visiting on campus, also it helps where you need to go a mile ahead 
                with respect to the normal college curriculum and how your peers approached companies, off campus.

            <div class="question">
                Is it ethical/legal to share interview questions?
            </div>
            <div class="answer">
                Yes and no. It's generally a yes for most of the companies except a few where you need to sign a bond for not doing so.
                However signing a NDA for interview questions is extremely rare.

            <div class="question">
                Can I share an experience on behalf of my friend?
            </div>
            <div class="answer">
                Technically you can do so. But we highly encourage not doing that because, the chances of errors increases and thereby the quality of 
                the content decreases.
